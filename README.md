# Noize

Project proudly developed during MLH Local Hack Day December 1, 2018 at UTSC.

## Description

Do you want to go somewhere more quiet? Are you or your family or friends afraid of noise pollution? Noize should be your go-to option to evade the noise.

With this app, you'll be able to see a heat map of noise level around you with our IoT deployed all over the city (someday in the future). It is fast and easy to install, while being very intuitve to use.
